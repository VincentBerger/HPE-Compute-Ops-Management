# Grafana Dashboard for HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management

This dashboard uses the Grafana Infinity plugin to interact with Compute Ops Management API. 

> For more information on how to monitor HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management infrastructure with Grafana Metrics Dashboards, see this [blog](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/how-to-monitor-hpe-compute-ops-management/) on the HPE Developer website. 

`Grafana Dashboard for HPE Compute Ops Management.json` contains everything you need (layout, variables, styles, data sources, queries, etc.) to import a predefined dashboard with different panels for HPE Compute Ops Management, including carbon emissions reports, server information and health, firmware bundles, groups information, etc.

Before importing the dashboard, be sure to change the clientID and clientSecret values with your HPE Compute Ops Management API client credentials generated from the HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform (GLCP).

```
  {
      "name": "VAR_CLIENTID",
      "type": "constant",
      "label": "clientID",
      "value": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "description": ""
    },
    {
      "name": "VAR_CLIENTSECRET",
      "type": "constant",
      "label": "clientSecret",
      "value": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "description": ""
    }
```

To learn how to import a Grafana dashboard, please see [Export and Import](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v9.0/dashboards/export-import/) from the Grafana docs


## Prerequisites

*  HPE Compute Ops Management API client credentials are required (this consists of a client ID and a client secret)
*  Infinity plugin is required

## Infinity plugin installation

From an SSH session on the Grafana server, enter:
> grafana-cli plugins install yesoreyeram-infinity-datasource

Then restart the Grafana service:
> service grafana-server restart

For more details on how to install the Infinity plugin, you can check out the [Infinity GitHub repository](https://github.com/yesoreyeram/grafana-infinity-datasource).

## Limitations

There are many advantages to using the Infinity plugin (lightweight solution, support for collecting any metric from any API, etc.), but be aware of the existing limitation of Compute Ops Management carbon footprint reporting: 
- Carbon footprint information is only available after a report is run
- The carbon footprint report, when run, collects data from the last seven days and Compute Ops Management only saves the most recent report

As a result, the vizualisation of the carbon footprint report panel of this dashboard will be only available after a report is run from the HPE GreenLake GUI and will be limited to seven days prior to the report run date. In addition, every time you want to get an updated graph, it is necessary to run a new report from the HPE GreenLake GUI. 

The only way to overcome these limitations today is to use a script to automate the execution of the carbon footprint report and to use a database such as the Influxdb/Prometheus software to save the report data beyond 7 days.
